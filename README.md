# Standards Scripts

## Purpose

Scripts that run on Travis to modify files in existing repos. They exist for every 'standards' repository associated with every supported language on Codecov. Travis CI lets users configure daily CRON jobs, thus this repo executes every script inside the 'scripts' folder on a daily basis
